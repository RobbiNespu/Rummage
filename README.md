# Todo
- Save last used settings
- Save a cache of used search terms to autocomplete in the future (windows is straight forward...OSX is going to need workaround)
- Expose dialog to set editor to use to open results
- Add replace option...if I feel like it
- Make result columns sortable
- Other stuff I think of
